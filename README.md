# Introduction to Infectious Disease Modeling

Slides and material on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.

The main presentation can be found here: [Introduction](https://ad-lectures.github.io/infectious-disease-modeling/Introduction.html)\
While the R practicals are reachable at:
* [SIR solver](https://ad-lectures.github.io/infectious-disease-modeling/SIR_solver.html)
* [Parameter estimation](https://ad-lectures.github.io/infectious-disease-modeling/SIR_par_estim.html)

The R code to generate the documents is available on Github: [https://github.com/AD-Lectures/infectious-disease-modeling](https://github.com/AD-Lectures/infectious-disease-modeling)
