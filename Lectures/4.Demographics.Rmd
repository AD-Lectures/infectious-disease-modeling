## Death and birth rates

The SIR model can be extended to include the population birth and death rates $\nu, \mu$.
This is a so called an **open population model**.

.pull-left[

```{r demo_model_scheme, echo = FALSE}
add_mathjax(grViz(
  r"(
    digraph SIR {

    graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10, margin=0]

    node [style = invis]
    N, MS, MI, MR

    node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica, style = filled]
    S [fillcolor = "#7EC1B3"]

    S -> MS [label = "$\\mu$"]
    I -> MI [label = "$\\mu$"]
    R -> MR [label = "$\\mu$"]
    I -> R [label = "$\\gamma$"]
    }
    )",
  height = 250, width = 500
))
```
]
.pull-right[

$$\frac{dS}{dt}=\nu N -\beta\frac{I}{N}S -\mu S$$
$$\frac{dI}{dt}=\beta\frac{I}{N}S-\gamma I - \mu I$$
$$\frac{dR}{dt}=\gamma I - \mu R$$
]

--

In this formulation the $S$ compartment **receives new individuals** with absolute rate $\nu$ while all compartments **lose individuals** with a relative rate $\mu$.

The basic reproduction number becomes:
$$\mathcal{R}_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma + \mu}$$
---

## Endemicity


In presence of birth and deaths, if the population is stable (i.e. $\nu = \mu$)
the epidemic either dies off $(\mathcal{R}_0 < 1)$ or it reaches an equilibrium (**endemic state**) $(\mathcal{R}_0 > 1)$, characterized by:

$$(S^*, I^*, R^*) = N\Big(\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_0},\frac{\mu}{\beta}(\mathcal{R}_0 - 1), 1 - \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_0} - \frac{\mu}{\beta}(\mathcal{R}_0 - 1)\Big)$$
--

```{r measles_endemic, echo = FALSE}
mu <- 1 / 80

state_measles <- local({
  beta <- 1.875
  gamma <- 1 / 8
  R0 <- beta / (gamma + mu)

  list(R0 = R0, S = 1 / R0, I = mu / beta * (R0 - 1), R = 1 - 1 / R0 - mu / beta * (R0 - 1)) %>% lapply(\(x) paste0(signif(x * 100, 3), "%"))
})

state_flu <- local({
  beta <- 0.325
  gamma <- 1 / 4
  R0 <- beta / (gamma + mu)

  list(R0 = R0, S = 1 / R0, I = mu / beta * (R0 - 1), R = 1 - 1 / R0 - mu / beta * (R0 - 1)) %>% lapply(\(x) paste0(signif(x * 100, 3), "%"))
})
```


For a population with $\mu = \nu = \frac{1}{80}$, $\beta = 1.875$, $\gamma = \frac{1}{8}$ which imply a  $\mathcal{R}_0 \approx 14$, in the **range of measles**, we get an equilibrium state of **S = `r state_measles$S`**, **I = `r state_measles$I`**, **R = `r state_measles$R`** as fractions of the population. This scenario means that the **great majority of the population will have antibodies** against measles.

--

A less invasive disease like **flu** $(\mathcal{R}_0 \approx 1.3)$ with parameters: $\beta = 0.325$, $\gamma = \frac{1}{4}$ produces a quite different endemic regime: **S = `r state_flu$S`**, **I = `r state_flu$I`**, **R = `r state_flu$R`**. Only a **small portion of the population is immunized** and it's **quickly replaced** by new naive newborns while immunized individuals die out.

## Age of infection

.pull-left[

When demographics are considered and disease-related mortality is ignored, at the equilibrium $\mathcal{R}_0$ can be used to estimate the **mean age of infection**:

$$A \approx \frac{1}{\mu(\mathcal{R}_0 - 1)}$$
Consequently, the age of first infection and the life expectancy $L = \frac{1}{\mu}$
allow to estimate $\mathcal{R}_0$ at equilibrium:

$$\mathcal{R}_0 = 1 + \frac{L}{A}$$

]

.pull-right[
![Age first encounter](img/Mean_age.png)
]

```{r age_infection, echo = FALSE}

age_measles <- local({
  beta <- 1.875
  gamma <- 1 / 8
  R0 <- beta / (gamma + mu)

  signif(1 / (mu * (R0 - 1)), 2)
})

age_flu <- local({
  beta <- 0.325
  gamma <- 1 / 4
  R0 <- beta / (gamma + mu)

  1 / (mu * (R0 - 1))
})
```


In the case of measles, using the parameter of the previous slide we get an average age of infection of $A = `r age_measles`$. This model works less well for weakly invasive diseases like flu, producing absurd values $(A = `r age_flu`)$, indicating that many people may never encounter the disease in their life.

---

## Endemic oscillations

The epidemic reaches the equilibrium through **oscillations**, whose period is:

$$T=2\pi\sqrt{AD}$$
with $A$ being the mean age of infection and $D=\frac{1}{\gamma + \mu}$ the average length of the infection period.

Regime for $\frac{1}{\mu} = 70$ years, $\beta = 520$ per year, and $\frac{1}{\gamma} = 7$ days, giving $\mathcal{R}_0 = 10$. Initial conditions were $S_{(0)} = 0.1$ and $I_{(0)} = 2.5 \times 10^{-4}$.

## Competing hazards

If $\mu$ was mortality due only to the disease (so applied just to the $I$ compartment), infectious individuals can either survive or die. The **survival rate** is modeled as:

$$\frac{\gamma}{\gamma + \mu}$$
Conversely the complementary of the survival rate is the **case-fatality rate**:

$$\frac{\mu}{\gamma + \mu}$$

## Summary

.blockquote[
The basic reproductive number is **lower when considering demographics** due to the **natural death of infected individuals**.

.blockquote[
In presence of demographics the epidemic **reaches an equilibrium** through an **oscillatory dynamic** of the infection prevalence.

.blockquote[
The age of first encounter with the disease **decreases with $\mathcal{R}_0$** while the number of seropositives **increases**.

.blockquote[
$\mathcal{R}_0$ can be estimated through the **age of first encounter and the life expectancy** once the epidemic equilibrium is reached
