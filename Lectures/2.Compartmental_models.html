Describes an epidemic in term of the disease status (compartments) of fraction of the population,
for example Susceptible `\((S)\)`, Infectious `\((I)\)`, Recovered `\((R)\)`. 

The individuals passes from between compartments according to specific rates.

for example Susceptible `\((S)\)`, Infectious `\((I)\)`, Recovered `\((R)\)`. 

The individuals passes from between compartments according to specific rates.

Based on the assumption of:
- **Homogeneous Mixing**: Everyone is potentially in contact with everyone else in
the population with a given rate.
- **Mass Action**: The population size is not relevant, only the proportional
partition in compartments -&gt; works well only for large populations.

### Susceptible-Infectious models
Mathematically are solved through **ordinary differential equations**.

There several modeling choices.

According to contact rate:
- **Frequency-based models**: The number of contacts is independent of the population/area.
- **Density-based models**: The number of contacts scales with the population/area.

According to the transmission mechanics:
- **Deterministic**: no random effects, parameters are fixed and equal for everyone
in a compartment. Given the same starting conditions, the epidemic trajectory is fixed.
- **Stochastic**: there is random variation at the individual level and/or at parameter level. Infectious event are discrete and random

The SIR models is a system of differential equations that describe the **change in time** `\((dt)\)` of the population in the compartments `\(S,I,R\)` according to **rates** `\(\lambda, \gamma\)`. The sum `\(S+I+R\)` equates to the whole population `\(N\)`. Sometimes is possible to work with **fractions of the population**, in that case `\(S+I+R=1\)`.

--

- The number of **individuals getting infected** in time, i.e., move from state `\(S\)` to state `\(I\)`, depends on the rate `\(\lambda\)` (**force of infection**) at which a susceptible individual get infected by entering in *efficacious contact* with **infectious individuals**, and on the total of **susceptible individuals** `\(S\)`. `\(\lambda S\)` represents also the disease **incidence rate**.

--
- The number of infected **individuals that recover**, i.e., move from state `\(I\)` to state `\(R\)`, depends on the number of **infected individuals** `\(I\)` and their **recovery rate** `\(\gamma\)`.

--

.blockquote[The model parameters, considered **fixed and equal on average** for the whole population (homogeneous-mixing), define the dynamic of the epidemic. In simple models, an **infected** individual is also **infectious**.]

### Differential equations

.pull-left[![Diff eq](img/calculus_33.jpg)]

.pull-right[
A **function** `\(y=f(x, ...)\)` describes the value of `\(y\)` (dependent variable, output) for various values of on or many `\(x\)` (indepentent variables, predictors, arguments, inputs). E.g. the position `\(y\)` of a car after a certain time `\(x\)`.

The **derivative** `\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)` describe how `\(y\)` is changing when `\(x\)` has a certain value. E.g. the velocity of the car at time `\(x\)`.

This change may not be fixed, but a function of the input and/or output `\(\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x,y,...)\)` themselves. This is a **differential equation**. E.g. velocity changes on mountain roads, slopes, traffic jams, etc...

A group of interconnected equation is called a **system of differential equations**, like the SIR model.
]

---

### Differential equations

.pull-left[
Differential equations are used to describe **dynamical systems**, that is systems
that evolve in **time**.

**Solving** a dynamical systems means find the **state of the system at a given time**.
These systems can be solved in two ways:

- **Analytical solution**: also called close-form, there is a set of mathematical
operations that given a time `\(t\)`, allows you to get the status of the system `\(\mathcal{S}_t\)` at that time.
This is possible only for very simple systems. E.g., a diff. eq. like `\(\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\)` means that `\(x(t)= x_0 + 3t\)`.

- **Numerical solution**: the only way to know `\(\mathcal{S}_t\)` is to simulate the system time step by time step `\(\mathcal{S}_t = f(\mathcal{S}_{t-1})\)`. Usually the only way to solve complex non-linear systems.

### What is actually `\(\lambda\)`?

The **force of infection** `\(\lambda\)` represents the **rate of infection** for a susceptible individual. It has two alternative formulations:

--

- **Frequency-based model**: `\(\lambda=\beta\frac{I}{N}=\pi \kappa \frac{I}{N}\)`: Given by the rate (number per unit time) of contacts `\(\kappa\)`  and the fraction of them who are infectious ( `\(\frac{I}{N}\)` ), multiplied by the probability `\(\pi\)` of transmitting the pathogen during such contacts. `\(\kappa\)` and `\(\pi\)` are joined in the **transmission term** `\(\beta\)` which represent the rate of at-risk contacts (independently from the disease status of contacts).

--
- **Density-based model**: `\(\lambda'=\beta'I=\pi \nu \frac{N}{A} \frac{I}{N}=\pi\frac{\nu}{A}I\)`: The number of contacts `\(k'=\nu \frac{N}{A}\)` is proportional to the density of the population in a certain area `\(\frac{N}{A}\)` scaled by a factor `\(\nu\)`. Often found in a simplified form after removing both `\(N\)` terms and joining `\(\pi\frac{\nu}{A}\)` in the transmission term `\(\beta\)`.

### Frequency vs Density based models

--
.pull-left[
**Frequency-based**
- The number of contacts is **fixed**, i.e., independent of denominator population and area.
- Useful disease in which the **observation area do not impact the number of possible contacts**, e.g., everyone meets on average the same number of people daily, whether in a medium city or in London, or for phisical contact diseases like STDs.
]

--
.pull-right[
**Density-based**
- The number of contacts **depends on population density** in the study area.
- Useful when comparing situations in which **population density drives the likelihood of contact**, like air-borne diseases in closed spaces or animal contacts on large areas.
]

--
.blockquote[
This difference is relevant when **applying parameters generated in another setting** (e.g., taken from literature); less relevant if new parameters are fitted from current data since they will incorporate the different assumptions.
]

We will consider only **frequency-based models** in the rest of the presentation.

---

### What is actually `\(\gamma\)`?

.blockquote[
It represent the **recovery rate** of infected individuals.
]

It derives from the average length of the infectious period which is `\(\frac{1}{\gamma}\)`. This latter value can be collected by clinical data or serology studies.

`\(\gamma\)` increases if patients are treated with a pharmacological/clinical solution that either remove the pathogen or makes it non infectious.

---

### Where do `\(\beta\)` and `\(\lambda\)` come from?

&lt;!-- A way to define it is the product of the (average) **number of contacts** `\(\kappa\)` by the **probability of a efficacious contact** `\(\pi\)` i.e. `\(\beta = \pi \kappa\)` (freq-based model). Actually this is a simplification of `\(\beta = -\kappa \text{log}(1 - \pi)\)` given that `\(\text{log}(1 - \pi) ≈ -\pi\)` se `\(\pi\)` is close to zero. But where does this come from? 

-- --&gt;

Consider `\(p\)` as the probability of **YOU getting infected** by an infectious individual and rethink `\(\pi\)` as the probability that **SOMEONE infects you**. `\(p\)` and `\(\pi\)` are equivalent when considering just a one-by-one contact. 

--

But what about the probability of getting infected by many individuals? First, consider that the probability of NOT getting infected is `\(1 - p = (1-\pi)\)`. Then, if there are `\(k\)` at risk contacts this probability becomes (with some assumptions):

`$$1-p=\prod_{i=1}^k(1-\pi_i) ≈ (1-\pi)^k$$`

(the probability of a group "independent" events it's the product of the individual event probabilities).

---

### Where do `\(\beta\)` and `\(\lambda\)` come from?

If not all contact are infectious and the exposure last for a certain time `\(t\)`, we can write the former as:

`$$1-p = (1-\pi)^{k\frac{I}{N}t}$$`
with `\(\frac{I}{N}\)` being the fraction of infectious individuals in the population.

--

Rearranging we get the **individual risk of infection**, given `\(k\frac{I}{N}\)` infectious contacts and exposure time `\(t\)`:

`$$p = 1 - (1-\pi)^{k\frac{I}{N}t}$$`
---

### Where do `\(\beta\)` and `\(\lambda\)` come from?

.pull-left[
What does `\(p = 1 - (1-\pi)^{k\frac{I}{N}t}\)` tell us? The probability of getting infected every given time is related to:
- the number of infectious contacts `\(k\frac{I}{N}\)`;
- the lenght of exposure with an infectious person `\(t\)`;
- the probability of infection given contact `\(\pi\)`.

- the probability of infection given contact `\(\pi\)`.

.blockquote[Epidemics can be controlled either by **reducing the number of contacts** (e.g. social distancing, closures, lockdowns) or by **decreasing the risk of contagion** given a contact (masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, short exposure time).]

### Where do `\(\beta\)` and `\(\lambda\)` come from?

If `\(\pi\)` is small (&lt; 10%), `\(\beta = \kappa\pi\)` can be rewritten as `\(\beta = -\kappa \text{log}(1-\pi)\)`, which allow to rewrite the individual risk formula `\(p = 1 - (1-\pi)^{k\frac{I}{N}t}\)` as:

`$$p = 1 - e^{-\beta \frac{I}{N}t}$$`
--

taking the derivative in time (ie. the change of risk in time) the **risk become a rate** and we get the **force of infection** `\(\lambda\)`:

`$$\frac{dp}{dt}=\beta \frac{I}{N}= \lambda$$`
--

.blockquote[The **force of infection** represents the individual **transmission rate** per individual per time unit.]

When multiplied by the number of still susceptible individuals, we get `\(\lambda S\)` which is the number of of cases in the epidemic per unit of time, i.e. the **incidence rate**.
